## Workflow

1. **Create Your Branch**
   - When you first start contributing, create your personal branch:
     ```sh
     git checkout -b <your-name>-branch
     ```
2. **Work on Your Branch**
   - Commit regularly to your branch with clear and concise commit messages.
   - Use meaningful commit messages to describe what each change does (e.g., `feat: add lexer functionality`).
